// --- Available levels
// "fatal" (60): The app is going to stop or become unusable now. An operator should definitely look into this soon.
// "error" (50): Fatal for a particular request, app continues servicing other requests.
// "warn" (40): A note on something that should probably be looked at by an operator eventually.
// "info" (30): Detail on regular operation.
// "debug" (20): Anything else, i.e. too verbose to be included in "info" level.
// "trace" (10): Logging from external libraries used by your app or very detailed application logging.
